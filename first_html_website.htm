<h1> Dhruv's first website : A little description about some Desi rappers </h1>
<h1>
Krsna : 
</h1>
<p>
For sure one of the best indian rappers in today's date . He is quite versatile and his skills are a bit too good for his time.It took like 14 years for him to get
recongnised in the mainstream. He is inspiring , a great model of perseverance , hardwork and patience.

He had the guiness world record of singing most words in a minute in a song and the numbers were astonishing . It was 384 words in a minute. He is young and he has a
mature depth in his songs despite his young age.

Personally my favourite rapper from pakistan . NO ONE RHYMES LIKE HIM. He can easily be called the desi rhyme lord. He has many mindblowing verses and he is as
brutal as satan when it comes to diss culture. He has the so called perfect ratio of depth in the lyrics , mindblowing rhyme schemes and man what unique flows!!!!

<h4> Still waiting for these three guys to collaborate on a single track , although they have collaborated with each other in the past but not on a same track.</h4>
